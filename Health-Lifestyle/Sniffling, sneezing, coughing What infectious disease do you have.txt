Several infectious diseases remain major global health threats. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest, causing over a million deaths yearly, especially in areas with limited healthcare. Ebola has a high fatality rate, with outbreaks like the 2014 crisis in West Africa killing thousands. HIV/AIDS weakens the immune system, leading to severe complications, though treatments have improved survival rates. Malaria, spread by mosquitoes, continues to affect millions, particularly in tropical regions.
Preventing these diseases requires vaccination, early detection, improved healthcare access, and global cooperation to reduce their spread and impact.
