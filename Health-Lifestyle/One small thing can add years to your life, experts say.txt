Water is essential for overall health, yet many people do not consume enough daily. The National Academy of Medicine recommends a daily intake of 3.7 liters (15.6 cups) for men and 2.7 liters (11.4 cups) for women to stay properly hydrated. Drinking enough water helps with weight management, as it can control calorie intake and support metabolism.
Proper hydration also prevents dehydration, which can lead to headaches, urinary tract infections, and kidney stones. Additionally, water plays a crucial role in lubricating joints, regulating body temperature, and supporting organ function. Maintaining adequate water intake is a simple yet vital habit for overall well-being.
