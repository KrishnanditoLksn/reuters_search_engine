A geriatrician emphasizes that adopting healthy habits can significantly improve quality of life as people age. Regular physical activity helps maintain mobility, balance, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains supports overall health and prevents deficiencies. Social engagement is also crucial, as it promotes mental well-being and reduces isolation. By incorporating these habits, individuals can enhance their longevity and maintain a higher quality of life as they grow older.â€‹
