The holiday season is a time of celebration, but it can also bring challenges to maintaining overall health. Managing stress and mental well-being is essential, as feelings of anxiety or the "holiday blues" are common. Engaging in mindfulness, setting realistic expectations, and practicing self-care can help reduce stress. Staying physically active through regular exercise, such as walking or yoga, supports both mental and physical health. Additionally, mindful eating is important—enjoying festive foods in moderation while prioritizing nutritious options like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can benefit overall well-being. Finally, getting enough sleep (7-9 hours per night) helps boost immunity and keeps energy levels stable. By adopting these habits, individuals can enjoy the holidays while maintaining their health. ​
