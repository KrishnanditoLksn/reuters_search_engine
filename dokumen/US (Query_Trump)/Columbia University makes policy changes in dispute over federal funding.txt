Columbia University makes policy changes in dispute over federal funding

Columbia University has announced a series of new policies, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum, making apparent concessions following President Trump’s revocation of $400 million in federal funding over campus protests. The Trump administration demanded several changes, including the university enforcing its disciplinary policies, implement rules for protests, ban masks, announce a plan to hold student groups accountable, empower its law enforcement, review its Middle East studies programs and its admissions. President Donald Trump has been threatening to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023. Columbia was the first to see its funding slashed. The last academic year saw widespread campus unrest, including pro-Palestinian protests and encampments, counterprotests, building takeovers, arrests and scaled-back graduation ceremonies.

Whether the university’s plans will lead to the release of the $400 million in funding is unclear. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Here are the main takeaways from the university’s announcement:
