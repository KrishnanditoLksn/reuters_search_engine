A South Carolina woman faces charges after igniting yard debris that burned out of control and allegedly sparked a wildfire that has scorched more than 2,000 acres near Myrtle Beach, the state’s forestry officials said.
Alexandra Bialousow, 40, of Myrtle Beach, was arrested Thursday on charges of negligently allowing fire to spread beyond her land or property and starting a fire in woodlands, grasslands or other areas without taking necessary precautions, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said in a statement Friday.
“According to the arrest warrant, the suspect ‘did not have an appropriate water source readily available,’ nor did she ‘have any garden tools on hand to control the fire’” and prevent it from escaping her yard, thus contributing to its spread to land owned by a homeowners association, the commission said.
