El Niño has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe.
El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean – has gripped the planet since the start of last summer. It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.
With El Niño out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Niña.
For now, neither La Niña nor El Niño are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Niña builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.
