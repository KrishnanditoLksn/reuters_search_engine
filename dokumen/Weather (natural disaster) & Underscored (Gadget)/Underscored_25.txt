Along with sweatpant jeans and nap dresses, house dresses are another comfy trend we’re all about this spring. They’re light and breezy, perfect for traveling or just pulling together a cute outfit as the weather warms up.

House dresses have been a seasonal favorite for the past few years, but they’re not a new fashion concept. “House dresses were originally from the 19th century and were intended for women to wear while doing housework or before they got ready to leave the house,” says wardrobe stylist and founder of Turnkey Style Elisa Ellis. “My grandma used to wear hers when she made us breakfast in the morning and cleaned the house.”

Although house dresses were traditionally only worn at home, and not in public, modern styles are fit for any casual occasion. They typically have a loose or flowy fit so you have room for movement, whether you’re doing housework, running errands or anything else.

“Over the years, the house dress style has evolved, and it has now become a versatile option women can wear at any time,” Ellis says. “Today, house dresses fall in the range of tunics, caftans, shift dresses, shirt dresses and more. They are also made to work for various styles, ages and body shapes.”

To help you find the one for you, we rounded up the best house dresses out there, including editor-approved styles and insight from fashion experts.
