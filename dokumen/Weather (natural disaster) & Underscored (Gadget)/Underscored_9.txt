Judul : I really like the Amazon Kindle Colorsoft — but is color worth $280?
Wartawan: Henry T. Casey
Isi: The Kindle Colorsoft might be the last e-reader you’ll ever need, as Amazon continues to check off the list of reader demands for how it can improve one of its most beloved products ever. This colorized version of the Kindle Paperwhite — our pick for the best e-reader — storms into the conversation for how you’ll read your books (and what you might be gifting the readers in your life this holiday season) by bringing covers, comics and more out of grayscale. The big question, though, is all about how much you value color, as it costs $80 to $120 more than its black and white sibling.

After one week with the Kindle Colorsoft, I can confirm that its price and the ability to make book covers, photos and comic books look a little more alive aren’t the only things you’re going to want to know about. From a neat little design choice on its back to a surprising difference between the screens and the major perk it shares with the current Paperwhite, there’s a lot going on in Amazon’s first color screen Kindle.
