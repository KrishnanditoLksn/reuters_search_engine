At least 10 people died this weekend as a powerful storm swept through a large swath of the United States, bringing widespread flooding and damaging winds to Southern and Eastern states.
In Kentucky, where flooding inundated roads and homes, at least nine are dead, Gov. Andy Beshear said in a post to social media Sunday.
“We just confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our total loss to 9 people,” Beshear said. At least one other person died in Georgia, an official there said.
