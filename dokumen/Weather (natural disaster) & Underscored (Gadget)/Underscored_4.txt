Isi: In a stroke of luck, some of our experts’ favorite workout clothing dramatically dropped in price, courtesy of the Athleta Friends & Family sale. The savings even extend far beyond its already discounted section to new arrivals and bestsellers.

Athleta’s site is chock-full of women’s clothes like leggings, joggers, sports bras and plenty of other fitness attire to suit any preferred workout, and it’s all up to 30% off. Consider it a special treat to loyal Athleta shoppers. No coupon code is necessary, as discounts are automatically applied and calculated at checkout.

These activewear deals almost seem too good to be true, so make sure you shop before stock dwindles or until the sale ends on March 25. To help speed up your browsing, I rounded up a solid list of our favorite pieces, selected by editors and tested by experts. P.S. The beloved Salutation leggings are marked as low as $50.
