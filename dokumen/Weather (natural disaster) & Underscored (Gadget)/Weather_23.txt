A powerful storm system is producing whiteout conditions in portions of the central United States and nearly 7 million people are under a tornado watch while residents in parts of the Plains remain under a threat for dangerous wildfires.
It isn’t a carbon copy of last week’s deadly, cross-country storm but will once again spawn severe thunderstorms and potential tornadoes, and its winds could trigger additional fast-moving fires.
The storm reached the Plains early Wednesday morning and strengthened considerably as it tracked into the Midwest in the afternoon, knocking out power and making travel treacherous.
