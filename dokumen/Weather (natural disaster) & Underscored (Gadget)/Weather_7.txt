The most intense rain to hit Southern California in over a year unleashed flooding, debris flows and mudslides that trapped cars and covered roadways, but spared areas burned in devastating wildfires from the catastrophe that was feared.
Some evacuation orders remain in the Los Angeles area through Friday afternoon for select residences near burn scar areas, even though the atmospheric river-fueled storm has since tracked out of California. There are lingering concerns over the potential for mudslides and rockslides, which can occur long after rainfall has ended, but the most dire threat has passed with the rain.
The storm dropped more rain on Los Angeles than the city had received in the last nine months combined. Most of it came from an intense line of storms that plowed through the city in the late afternoon, triggering flash flood warnings in the city and its burn scars, including the Eaton and Palisades fire zones. The storm was so intense, the National Weather Service issued a rare severe thunderstorm warning for Los Angeles, warning of 60 mph winds.
