Evacuation warnings have been issued in parts of Los Angeles County ravaged by deadly wildfires last month, as Southern California’s most significant storm in more than a year stokes fears of life-threatening debris flows and a high risk of mudslides.
It’s just one of three winter storms this week brought about by a hyperactive weather pattern that’s been slamming the US with snow, ice and rain since the start of the month – another storm is currently hitting the Plains and Midwest with heavy snow.
In addition to the evacuation warnings across Southern California, preparations aimed at preventing debris flow disaster are underway before the worst conditions from California’s storm arrive Thursday.
