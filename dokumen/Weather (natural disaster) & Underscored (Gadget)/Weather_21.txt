The strongest storm system of spring so far roared across the Midwest and South Friday night into Saturday morning, spawning what could end up being dozens of tornadoes that raked through towns in darkness — the most dangerous and deadly time for a tornado outbreak.
The magnitude of the damage was unclear in the early-morning hours Saturday as forecasters at the National Weather Service furiously issued tornado warnings and the radar lit up with severe thunderstorms from Wisconsin to Mississippi.
It’s part of a major, cross-country low pressure system that has killed three people so far and pounded the central US with hurricane-force gusts, creating a blinding dust storm and fanning wildfire flames.
