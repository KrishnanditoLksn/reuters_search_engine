Isi: Summer vacation is here, and this year, instead of spending your hard-earned cash on the inflated prices that come with summer travel, there are clever ways to use travel rewards so you pay less for your next trip.

According to Kayak — a popular online travel agency — the cost of summer travel is down this year, but their summer travel study also shows the average US domestic airfare is still a whopping $455. While that is 13% lower than last summer, taking that summer trip certainly isn’t cheap, so offsetting costs by redeeming points and miles for airfare and hotel stays is the way to go.

Here are a few tips for earning and redeeming travel rewards points and miles for your summer vacation. You’ll learn the best travel credit cards to earn with, how to efficiently redeem your rewards and tips for finding award flights and hotel stays.
