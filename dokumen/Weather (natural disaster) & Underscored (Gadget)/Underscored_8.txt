Judul : The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is really impressive, but I’m still frustrated

Isi: While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra might seem incredibly familiar, it’s a notably different phone than the Galaxy S24 Ultra I tested and praised last year. The best news is that this big phone delivers a huge battery life boost, one without caveats or compromises — and that’s enough to ensure that it’s one of our favorite smartphones.

The bad news comes in a redesign that reshapes the phone and makes me rethink how I’m going to hold it. And, of course, there’s more of Samsung’s Galaxy AI features under the hood, along with a new chip that enables better performance than ever. So, before you think about hitting preorder, let’s dive into what I liked and disliked about the Galaxy S25 Ultra.
