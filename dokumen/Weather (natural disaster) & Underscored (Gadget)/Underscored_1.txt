Isi: Google’s Pixel 9a doesn’t just look like a strong successor to last year’s Pixel 8a; this budget-friendly phone also looks like the best phone that won’t break the bank. It’s not only (just barely) under $500 but also notably less pricey than the latest budget iPhone while packing perks that Apple makes you pay more for. The Pixel 9a also stands above the similarly priced Samsung Galaxy A36 with additional support, which should ensure a possible lifespan though 2032.

So, if you’re trying to figure out if you should get the Pixel 9a, I’ve outlined everything you need to know below. Also, Google’s handling the Pixel 9a’s release differently than most flagship phones: There is no option to preorder yet, though you can sign up at Google’s online store to be notified about this smartphone’s release date in April 2025.
