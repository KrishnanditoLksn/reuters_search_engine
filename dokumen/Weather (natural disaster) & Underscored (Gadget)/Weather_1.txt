Newly obtained records – including text messages and internal reports – detail how Los Angeles officials scrambled to respond in the hours leading up to the devastating wildfires that swept through the city earlier this year.
The exchange of messages reveals how authorities initially assessed and activated the lowest level of emergency management to address the Palisades Fire, before the windswept blazes overwhelmed the response, displacing tens of thousands of residents in the Pacific Palisades area and testing the city’s emergency response systems.
The Palisades and Eaton wildfires – the most destructive in recent years – left 29 people dead and scorched nearly 60,000 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. More than half of the deaths were reported in areas where residents said they either did not receive evacuation orders or did so hours after the rapidly spreading blaze started.
