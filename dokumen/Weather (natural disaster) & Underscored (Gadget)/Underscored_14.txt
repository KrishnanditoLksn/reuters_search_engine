Isi: Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic is known for its pristine beaches and excellent all-inclusive resorts. And if you’re traveling from the US Midwest or East Coast in the winter, it’s a great place to escape the snow.
Even better? Right now, you can book flights to Punta Cana for as low as $255 round trip from various US cities this November and December — far cheaper than the $500-plus you’ll often see on these routes.

Thrifty Traveler Premium — one of our favorite flight deal alert services — alerted us of these low-cost flights offered by American, Delta and JetBlue. You’ll find the deal to Punta Cana from Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C. and other major US cities.

But, as always, act fast if you want to book this deal. Flight prices can change on a dime, and this low fare may not be available if you wait to book. Here’s a (limited) look at what flights are available from the US to Punta Cana. More dates and departure cities may be available too.
