Tropical cyclone Garance made landfall on the French Indian Ocean territory of Réunion on Friday, packing gusts of 166 kilometers (103 miles) per hour.
Garance – the equivalent of a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane – made landfall on the northern coast of the mountainous island, France’s meteorological agency said.
Garance is the strongest storm to hit the territory, located about 400 miles off the coast of Madagascar, since Tropical Cyclone Firinga in January 1989.
