A powerful storm that dropped drenching rain on flood-prone Southern California is raising concern among forecasters that it could produce a dangerous, widespread outbreak of tornadoes, damaging winds and fires along with a blizzard as it crosses the entire United States in the coming days.
The heavy rain triggered mudslides that engulfed part of a roadway and trapped multiple vehicles in San Jacinto in California’s Riverside County Thursday morning. At least six people were rescued, evaluated by paramedics and released, the county’s fire department said on social media.
The storm also produced a short-lived EF0 tornado that damaged some homes and cars in Pico Rivera – southeast of Los Angeles – in the early morning, according to the National Weather Service.
