Isi: Wayfair’s Spring Cyber Week is finally here. The online retailer’s entire site is up to 80% off, making this event the best set of home deals of the week. Amazon’s Big Spring Sale is slated for next week, but there’s no need to wait with such steep Wayfair deals. We’re constantly covering Wayfair furniture here at Underscored and love how reliable and oftentimes affordable the online home store can be. That makes today’s sale even better for refreshing your home decor on a budget.

If you’re overwhelmed by its wide variety of stock, don’t fret. You’ll have four more full days to shop the sale. To make it easier, I’ve handpicked 20 of my favorite pieces that you can snag below.
