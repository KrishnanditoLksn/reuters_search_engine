The yearâ€™s first deadly US tornado struck after dark Thursday, killing two people in a small East Tennessee community as the first of five back-to-back, jet stream-driven winter storms pummeled the eastern United States.
Severe weather blasted through Morgan County, killing a mother and daughter in the same home, the county Emergency Management & Homeland Security office said Friday. No ages or other identifying information were given.
Three injuries also were reported, the agency said, in a county that is no stranger to deadly and damaging tornadoes. More than a dozen homes were damaged by the storm, county officials said Friday afternoon.
