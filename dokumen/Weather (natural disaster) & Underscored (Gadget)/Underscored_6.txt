Isi: Goodbye iPhone SE, hello iPhone 16e. Apple just replaced its long-running budget phone with a new handset that’s much more like its regular iPhone — and you can preorder it right now. But this new member of the iPhone family arrives with both good and bad news.

Apple’s packed the iPhone 16e with display, performance and camera upgrades, and it’s still cheaper than the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro. However, the $429 iPhone SE it’s replacing was a truer budget phone, as the iPhone 16e’s price is closer to the iPhone 16 than you might expect. And while the iPhone 16e gets a lot of the design perks (including Face ID) that the iPhone 16 offers, it’s not as small as the SE was, which will undoubtedly irk the small-phone faithful among us.

That’s admittedly a whole lot to talk about, so let’s break down everything we just learned so you can know if you want to buy one right now, as preorders began today (Friday, Feb. 21).
