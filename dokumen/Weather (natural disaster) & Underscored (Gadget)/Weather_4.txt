An atmospheric river brought heavy rain, serious mountain snow and strong winds to California that flooded roads and rivers and triggered landslides, with at least two storm-related deaths reported – and more rain is on the way.
The first storm, which impacted a large swath of the state, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, tapered off on Wednesday.
Northern California bore the brunt of the impacts, with reports of landslides and flooding in urban and low-lying areas. Two people were reported dead in Sonoma County due to the flooding, the sheriff’s office said.
