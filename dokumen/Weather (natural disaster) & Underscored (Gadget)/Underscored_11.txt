Isi: As I sit here in my hotel room trying to get as much work done as possible on a single laptop screen amid the chaos of CES 2025, I can’t help but think that the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is made for me. With the single push of a button, this laptop can expand its screen upward, giving you a nearly 17-inch canvas for comfortably multitasking or watching blown-up vertical videos.

It’s a jaw-dropping gimmick for sure, but it also comes with an equally jaw-dropping $3,500 price tag — and a few other caveats that I was surprised to see at this price. So, is Lenovo’s latest high-tech laptop a practical productivity tool or just a cool party trick? Here’s what I think after getting my hands on it myself.
