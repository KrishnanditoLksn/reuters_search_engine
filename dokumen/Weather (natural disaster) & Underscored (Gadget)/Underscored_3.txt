Isi: Luggage brand Béis is well-known among avid travelers and commuters. It recently launched a new collection of versatile bags designed with activity in mind. The collection features a few new colors of some of the brand’s staples like the Sport Duffel Backpack and the Carry-On Roller. There are also new bag styles, including the Crescent Catchall, Sport Tote, North to South Backpack, Magnetic Water Bottle Sling, and Toiletry Bag, adding to the brand’s silhouettes.

I was intrigued by the new collection for a few reasons. First, I wanted to get a feel for how well the bags supported an on-the-go schedule and if they could properly handle various sporty activities. I was also curious about how they’d fit into my day-to-day.

But I was skeptical when first seeing some of the prices. Was I thrilled about spending $24 on the collection’s Sport Charms? Not exactly. But while I didn’t get my hands on those charms, I spent several months testing the Crescent Catchall, Sport Tote, North to South Backpack, Toiletry Bag and Magnetic Water Bottle Sling. In the end, three of the new bags fit seamlessly into my day to day. Here’s what it was like carrying the latest styles from the Béis Sport Collection — the good and the bad.
