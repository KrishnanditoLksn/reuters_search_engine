A powerful storm system that tore across the United States in recent days was winding down Monday, but in its wake are devastated communities hit with violent tornadoes, wildfires and dust storms spun off by the massive system.
At least 42 people died in storm-related incidents in eight states, according to officials. Missouri has the most deaths with 12, followed by Kansas with eight. Most of Alabama was severely impacted, and at least three died there.
“Disaster,” one Alabama resident told CNN, when asked to describe the scene. “I’ve seen nothing like this since I was a kid.”
Recent layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, coupled with potential cuts and drastic changes to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have sparked widespread concern about the nation’s ability to respond to severe weather and natural disasters.
The remainder of the rain and storms from the system exited the mid-Atlantic early Monday but wet weather was to linger in the Northeast into the evening.
