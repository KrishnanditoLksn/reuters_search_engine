Isi: A supportive pillow can make all the difference when it comes to achieving a more restful night’s sleep, especially for those dealing with neck pain. In fact, investing in the right pillow now can help prevent discomfort and regret down the road.

According to Leah Kaylor, a clinical and prescribing psychologist who specializes in sleep and trauma, people who suffer from chronic neck pain not only have a harder time falling asleep but a tougher time staying asleep. But that’s not all. Poor sleep can lead to a host of other problems that can negatively impact your general well-being. “When a person is consistently not getting good sleep, this leaves them vulnerable to memory problems, decreased attention span, brain fog, as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression,” she says.

While pillows aren’t a magical solution (though we wish that were the case), they can offer some relief, which, in turn, can improve the quality of your sleep. “A well-designed pillow plays a crucial role in sleep posture and spinal alignment,” Kaylor says. “When you have a pillow that properly supports the head, it reduces the strain on the neck muscles and relieves pressure points. Not only does this enhance relaxation but it increases circulation and reduces pain-related awakenings. You are also less likely to wake up with morning stiffness, pain or inflammation by having proper support.”
