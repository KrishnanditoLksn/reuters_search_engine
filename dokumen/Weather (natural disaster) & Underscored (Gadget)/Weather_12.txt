La Niña has finally emerged after months of anticipation, but there’s a catch. The climate pattern — which typically has an outsized influence on winter weather in the US — is rather weak and may not stick around for long.
But that won’t totally eliminate its effect. And, despite its late arrival, it’s already played a clear role in this winter’s weather.
Forecasters closely monitor La Niña and its counterpart El Niño because they influence global weather in a way that’s largely consistent and predictable well in advance – especially when the patterns are strong.
