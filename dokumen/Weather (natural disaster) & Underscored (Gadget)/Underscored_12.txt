Wartawan: Michael Berk
Isi: Mechanical keyboards — in which every key uses an individual physical switch to send information to your computer, rather than activating a contact on a membrane as in a modern laptop keyboard — have been growing in popularity as gamers, developers, writers and a growing number of enthusiasts have pushed back on the thinner-is-better aesthetic of modern computer design, looking to the past for a typing experience that’s bigger, louder and easier on the fingers.

We spent the last year of workdays typing, navigating and otherwise putting 50 (yes, it’s too many, we know) popular and not-so-popular mechanical keyboards through their paces (we also wrote this very article using the relevant products under review). We found a whole bunch of great models, so regardless of your typing style, we’ve picked out the best mechanical keyboard for you.
