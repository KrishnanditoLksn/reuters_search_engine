Isi: Even if you don’t give into beauty trends, you probably own this invaluable beauty tool: the hair dryer. Historically, they’ve been large and loud. Now, however, a new generation of hair dryers are bringing true innovation to the appliance, making them lighter, quieter and more efficient. The L’Oréal Professionnel AirLight Pro is one such tool that caught our eye at CES last year (and we recently saw even more innovative beauty tech at CES 2025). The AirLight Pro looked like something from the future, and we even named it one of the most-anticipated launches of 2024. Since it launched in November, I’ve been testing the hair dryer to see how it measures up.

The AirLight Pro’s most prominent feature is the circle of light on the front of the hair dryer. And it’s not just for looks; it’s actually an infrared light, which was developed in partnership with Zuvi, a hardware startup created by scientists and drone engineers. (Zuvi launched its own version of an infrared light hair dryer in 2022.) Together, the L’Oréal and Zuvi were able to apply the patented infrared technology to a smarter, more efficient hair dryer that promises to deliver smooth, less damaged hair. But at $475, is it really worth the cost?
