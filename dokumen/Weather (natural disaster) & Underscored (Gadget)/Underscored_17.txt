Isi: In the realm of beauty, the night holds immense potential for rejuvenation and repair. From skin-soothing sleep masks to nourishing hair masks and even restorative foot treatments, overnight beauty products can boost your routine from head to toe.

As board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ashley Magovern of Manhattan Dermatology in Manhattan Beach, California, says, “The skin is connected to all the other cells in our body, and they know what to do at night. It’s important to have a nighttime routine so that your skin cells (and all your cells) maintain their routine and daily cycle.
“What’s great about overnight beauty treatments is that you can mix and match targeted products to address your specific hair or skin care needs based on your [body’s] ever-changing concerns,” she continues, adding that overnight beauty products work seamlessly with no added time to your daily routine — all while gaining maximum results.
