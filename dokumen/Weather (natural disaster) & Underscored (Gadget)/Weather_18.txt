A slow-moving tropical storm has crossed Australia’s heavily populated eastern coast, lashing the region with damaging winds and heavy rain that’s forecast to fall for days to come.
Cyclone Alfred, which weakened to a tropical low weather system on Saturday, seems to have spared the region the worst of its potential impact.
However, hundreds of thousands of homes in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales were without power on Sunday, due to fallen trees and downed powerlines, and authorities warned that flooding remained a serious risk.
“The situation … remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds, heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts, and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Sunday.
