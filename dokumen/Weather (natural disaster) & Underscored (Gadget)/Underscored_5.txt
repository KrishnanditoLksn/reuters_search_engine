Judul : Testing XGIMI’s MoGo 3 Pro portable projector completely changed how I watch TV

Isi: When I set out to test the XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro projector, I had two goals in mind: to evaluate the product (it is my job, after all) and explore a new viewing experience. I use my TV a lot. Be it for binging shows, obsessing over sports or playing video games, it’s the focal point of my apartment and the gateway to so many things I enjoy. But it’s hardly top-of-the-line; it’s an unremarkable 50-inch display I haven’t replaced for years mainly because it still works. And doing so would cost money.

So, ditching that TV for a projector was an experiment I’ve long considered and one that could theoretically upgrade my screen time without blowing up my budget. Because, sure, Samsung’s beloved FrameTV could transform my living space, and, of course, one of the best TVs on the market would undoubtedly present improved visuals. But I wanted something bigger without paying for an expensive black hole on my wall.

That’s when I found the portable XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro. I was initially intrigued by its affordable price, but then it won me over by outperforming that dollar amount. It transformed my one-bedroom abode into a big-screen cinema, then a multi-TV sports bar. When I didn’t need those indulgences, it folded shut and disappeared.

But is it the absolute best projector for anyone eyeing a TV alternative? And how does it stack up against models priced well into quadruple digits? After a few months with the MoGo 3 Pro projecting onto my walls, I found answers — and reached a surprising conclusion.
