Judul : I spent three months with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and I don’t want to go back

Isi: Every year, Apple delivers new iPhones that arrive with waves of hype. And while I put the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max through their paces last September, I’ve become eager to write more about Apple’s pricier smartphones for those who aren’t curious about the new iPhone 16e. That’s because a funny thing happened as I spent the last months testing the iPhone 16 Pro Max review unit as my main phone: it became much more important to me than I expected.

A key feature that I didn’t rave about in my initial iPhone 16 Pro review stood out so much that I felt lesser-than without it when I recently had to revert back to my iPhone 15 Pro Max. The post-release months also saw Apple release its long-hyped suite of Apple Intelligence tools, which I finally got to try for myself. So, after a few months of living with Apple’s greatest iPhone, I’m ready to give a more-complete, long-term review of the iPhone 16 Pro Max for those considering an upgrade.
