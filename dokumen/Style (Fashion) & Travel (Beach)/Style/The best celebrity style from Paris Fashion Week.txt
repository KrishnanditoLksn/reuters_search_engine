When fashion week takes over a city, celebrities are never far from the action — often in carefully curated outfits that live on our moodboards for the rest of the year.

The Fall-Winter 2023 shows during Paris Fashion Week were no different. Julia Fox turned the cobblestoned streets into a personal catwalk in a Courrèges look from the label’s show on Wednesday, while singer Halsey’s silver chainmail headdress fit right in at Paco Rabanne’s first runway in 25 years.
