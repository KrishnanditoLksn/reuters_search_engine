By Alli Rosenbloom, CNN


This year’s edition will be hosted by LL Cool J, who is returning for the second time to host the show that will recognize the most-played artists and songs on iHeartRadio stations throughout 2024.

Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar are among those up for awards, with Mariah Carey, Nelly and Lady Gaga each set to receive special honors. Billie Eilish, GloRilla and Kenny Chesney are among the hitmakers who will perform during the telecast.

This year’s ceremony will also pay tribute to Los Angeles after devastating wildfires impacted the area in January by driving donations to Fireaidla.org, the effort established in the disaster’s aftermath to benefit short-term relief efforts and long-term initiatives to prevent future fires.

Here’s everything you need to know about how to watch on the iHeartRadio Music Awards:
