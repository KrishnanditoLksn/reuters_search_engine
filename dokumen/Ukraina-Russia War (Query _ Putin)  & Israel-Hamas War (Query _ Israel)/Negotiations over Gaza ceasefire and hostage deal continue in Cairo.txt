Negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, in an indirect fashion and under Egyptian mediation, continued in Cairo on Sunday, Egypt’s state-run media Al-Qahera News reported Sunday, citing a senior source.

“The proposed truce includes a detainee exchange deal and mechanisms for the return of the displaced in the Gaza Strip,” the news agency said in a post on X.

Hamas said in a statement as its delegation arrived Sunday that it is keen to reach an agreement that would see a “complete cessation of aggression.”

The group also reiterated its demands, including a withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes, reconstruction of the damage in Gaza from Israel’s military, and a “completion of a prisoner exchange deal” involving a mutual release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Israel has repeatedly called Hamas’ demands “delusional.”

This weekend’s talks come six months into the conflict, and as the Israeli military withdrew troops from the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday, saying they will regroup and prepare for further missions in the strip.
