Hamas delegation arrives in Cairo for further talks
From CNN’s Ibrahim Dahman in Cairo

A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo on Sunday for further talks on a ceasefire deal, a senior Hamas source told CNN, where negotiators from the US, Israel and Egypt are also expected to attend.

The Hamas source refused to confirm any details about the militant group’s positions or demands, saying what is being reported in the media “is speculation and leaks.”

The source did not say who was in the delegation, and asked not to be named discussing the closed-door negotiations.

The upcoming talks are expected to be held at the expert level, with Israel and Hamas representatives communicating from separate rooms.

On Saturday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that Israel had “basically accepted” a six-week ceasefire proposal in Gaza. According to the official, the sticking point in the deal is that Hamas has not yet agreed to a “defined category of vulnerable hostages.”
