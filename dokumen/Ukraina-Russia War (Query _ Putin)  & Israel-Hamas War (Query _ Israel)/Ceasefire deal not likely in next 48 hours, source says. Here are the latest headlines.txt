Ceasefire deal not likely in next 48 hours, source says. Here are the latest headlines
From CNN staff

Hamas wants Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire, a highly placed diplomatic source told CNN, as talks resumed in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday.

The source said it was very unlikely there will be a deal in the next 48 hours. That source said there are two key issues stalling an agreement:

Without Israel agreeing to permanent ceasefire or at least a path to a ceasefire, Hamas will not release the remaining Israeli hostages.
And there must be a guarantee of a certain amount of aid getting to both the north and south of Gaza.
Earlier, a senior official in US President Joe Biden’s administration said Israel has “basically accepted” a six-week ceasefire proposal in Gaza, and that there is a “framework deal.” The sticking point, the official says, is that Hamas has not yet agreed to releasing a “defined category of vulnerable hostages.”

Prominent voices from Biden’s party have urged the US to focus on securing a ceasefire deal and, eventually, an end to the conflict. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that the killing of innocent people in Gaza “has to stop.” And Sen. Chris Murphy told the Washington Post that if the war continues to look like the carnage that unfolded at a food aid convoy on Thursday, “it is not in the US interest to continue to be a part of that.”
