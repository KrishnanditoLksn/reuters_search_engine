The Israel Defense Forces is “far from stopping” military operations in the Gaza Strip, its chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said at a news conference Sunday.

“We will not leave any Hamas brigades active, in any part of the Gaza Strip. We have plans and will act when we decide,” he said, adding that the military’s goals in Gaza have not been fully achieved, including the return of all hostages, the return of displaced residents to the north, and the dismantling of Hamas throughout the enclave.

In response to a question about the military’s withdrawal of ground forces from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Halevi claimed Hamas’ military wing had been diminished to operating as “small terrorist cells.”

He reiterated that the IDF has not left the Gaza Strip and that there are “many troops at this very hour” in the strip.

The country’s defense minister made similar remarks earlier Sunday, saying the withdrawing troops will regroup and then prepare for new missions, including in Rafah.
