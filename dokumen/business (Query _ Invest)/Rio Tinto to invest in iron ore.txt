(CNN) -- International mining company Rio Tinto says it will invest $3.1 billion to significantly increase iron ore production in Australia.

The goal is to produce 283 million tons of iron ore starting in 2013, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

The company can currently produce 220 million tons of iron ore a year.

The increased production will help the company do more rail and infrastructure projects in western Australia, the company said.
