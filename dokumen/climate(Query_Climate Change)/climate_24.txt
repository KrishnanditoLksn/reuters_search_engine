Why the US is so horribly incapable of meaningful climate action 


While the worldâ€™s climate is hot and getting hotter, the US government is frozen in time.
Runways are melting in the UK. Lakes are drying up in the US. Fires are raging all over.
But the federal government is stuck in amber, blocked by a Supreme Court that pines for a pre-industrial age, insisting on new laws for the Environmental Protection Agency to fight climate change, and beholden to a custom in the Senate that makes any new climate law all but impossible.
