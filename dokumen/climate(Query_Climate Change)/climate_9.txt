Hotter, rainier, wetter — climate change is dramatically transforming the Arctic, report finds 

Authored by more than 140 scientists around the globe, the Arctic Report Card examined the region’s “vital signs” between October 2021 and September 2022, including changes in snow cover, sea ice volume, air and ocean temperatures, as well as a new pulse-check on precipitation events.The report “demonstrates that we are seeing many of the most intense impacts of climate change first in the Arctic,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told CNN. “I can’t overstate this but rapid warming in the Arctic is profoundly affecting more than 400,000 Indigenous people who live there, and in many instances is upending their entire way of life.”
