New report paints dire picture of America’s future as climate crisis accelerates 

The National Climate Assessment, which is a congressionally-mandated report the federal government releases every four or five years, summarizes all the latest science and research on climate change in the United States. The new draft, which will go through a long period of public review before it is officially published next year, provides vital context about the very real pain the climate crisis is causing in the United States today, and how far we are from creating a world safe for future generations.

It is both familiar – as we have lived with these impacts for years now – and devastating to see it laid out in such stark synthesis.
